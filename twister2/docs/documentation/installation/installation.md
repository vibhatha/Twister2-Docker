Twister2 Installation
=====================

One of our primary goals is to make the installation of Twister2 as simple
as possible. We are on our way to achieve that goal but we are not fully there yet.

Once you have downloaded a twister2 distribution or compile it from the source,
all you need to do is extract that distribution. That is all you need
for the simple cases.
